"Machine Learning Approaches to Understanding and Mitigating Educational Disparities"
Using: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
Performed a thorough analysis of the data on educational inequality utilizing hyperparameter tuning and machine learning approaches (KNN, K-Means, Mean Shift, ANN, and ARIMA). EDA improved model performance (RMSE, silhouette scores), and heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms were used to display the insights.
